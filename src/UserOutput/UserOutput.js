            <p>Just my luck, no ice. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?</p>
            <p>Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? I was part of something special. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?</p>
